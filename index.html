            Bringing a four-legged friend home for the first time can be super exciting, but it’s also a lot to take in for you both! We’ve pulled together all our best tips to help first-time dog owners.

            The first thing you’ll need to do after choosing your pet and making sure they’re right for you is to dog-proof your home. You’ll need to make sure your dog has their own area set up and that anything harmful is well out of paws’ reach!

             If there are any areas of your house you don’t want your dog going (or you want to limit when they can and can’t go in them) you might want to look at installing baby gates. These are a great way of teaching your dog where they can and can’t go. They’ll also enable your dog to see you if you go into a room they’re not allowed in (which can be very reassuring for them). You can read more about creating a dog-friendly home on our advice pages.

            You’ll need to make sure you have a dog-friendly garden. If you’re getting your dog from a rescue centre, they’ll often come and check that your home is suitable and tell you how you can improve it. It’s important to make sure your garden is secure and that there are no harmful plants where your dog can reach.

            Before bringing your new dog home, check out our handy checklist to make sure you have all the supplies you’ll need. New places can be overwhelming for some dogs so you’ll need to make sure everything is nice and calm at home on the day they arrive. You might want to limit them to one or two rooms in the house at first so they can get used to everything slowly in their own time.

            Plug-in diffusers that release calming pheromones can be good for the first few weeks. These release hormones that won’t harm your dog but will help them to feel more relaxed around the home.
        
            It’s important to get your dog into a routine as soon as possible to help them settle. Try to feed and walk them at the same time every day. Make sure their microchip details are up to date and that they are fully vaccinated before you take your dog out into the big wide world!
