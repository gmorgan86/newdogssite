            Once you've chosen your pet and made sure they're perfect for you, the first thing you'll need to do is dog-proof your house. You'll want to make sure your dog has their own space and that anything dangerous is out of reach of their paws!

            You may want to consider installing baby gates in areas of your home where you don't want your dog to go (or where you want to restrict where they can and can't go). These are an excellent way to show your dog where he or she can and should not go. They'll even encourage your dog to see you if you enter a room where they're not permitted (which can be very reassuring for them).

            You'll want to make sure your garden is dog-friendly. If you're adopting a dog from a shelter, they'll also come to your house and see if it's appropriate and give you advice on how to make it better. It's important to ensure that your garden is safe and that your dog cannot access any dangerous plants.

            Check out our helpful checklists on the diet and training pages, before taking your new dog home to make sure you have everything you'll need. For certain pets, new environments can be daunting, so make sure all is quiet and calm at home on the day they arrive. You might want to confine them to one or two rooms in the house at first so that they can gradually become accustomed to everything.

            For the first few weeks, plug-in diffusers that release soothing pheromones can be beneficial. These trigger hormones that will not hurt your dog but will make him feel more at ease in the house.
        
            It's important to establish a routine for your dog as soon as possible to aid in their adjustment. Feed and walk them at the same time every day if possible. Before you take your dog out into the great wide world, make sure their microchip information is up to date and that they are completely vaccinated. <br>
