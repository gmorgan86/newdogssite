<h2>Commonly Asked Questions About Dogs</h2>    

<h3>Why do dogs have wet noses?</h3>
<p>
    The ability of a dog's nose to identify scents is up to 10,000 times more sensitive than that of a human's. They can detect one rotten apple among 2 MILLION barrels of apples, for example. A wet nose improves the capacity of the glands in the nose to trap olfactory chemicals in secretions.
    <br>
    <br>
    Some dogs lick their noses, giving them a "wet nose" appearance and aiding smell identification by processing chemicals in olfactory centres in the roof of their mouths. As a means of controlling body temperature, dogs develop more secretions from their nose.
    <br>
    <br>
    Sweat glands can be located in the feet and nose, so a wet nose can help them stay cool. Is it necessary to be concerned if my dog has a dry nose? No way! A dry nose is not an indication of disease if the dog is otherwise content and well, with no dried discharge around the nostrils.
</p>

<h3>Why is my dog panting?</h3>
<p>
    We're back to your dog's peculiar sweat gland distribution and capacity to cool down. Excess heat is lost when air flows through your dog's airways and they don't sweat like humans. Although a dog's usual breathing rate is about 30-40 breaths per minute, a panting dog can breathe up to 300-400 times per minute.
    <br>
    <br>
    Stress, pain, endocrine diseases, heatstroke, and heart or respiratory problems such as tracheal collapse are all possible causes of abnormal panting. Bring abnormal panting to your veterinarian's attention if your dog doesn't need to relax in a warm environment.
</p>

<h3>Why does my dog eat poop?</h3>
<p>
    This is a disgusting situation, particularly if you witness it and then your dog tries to give you a huge, sloppy kiss. From an evolutionary standpoint, dog mothers eat their young pups' faeces to keep the den clean and free of odours that could attract predators.
    <br>
    <br>
    Some puppies carry this behaviour with them to their new home, but most develop out of it as the dog matures; however, if they aren't on a well-balanced diet or have digestive problems like intestinal parasites or pancreatic disease, the behaviour may continue.
    <br>
    <br>
    Some dogs eat faeces to relieve tension, boredom, or to enjoy the attention they get, even if it is negative, or to escape punishment.
    <br>
    <br>
    Some dogs eat poop just because they like the taste! Discourage the opportunity to eat stool by picking up poop immediately.
</p>

<h3>Why Do Dogs Sniff Each Otherâ€™s Butts?</h3>
<p>
    Scent labelling and detection are done with anal glands, which secrete a foul-smelling substance. They can process scents that have no discernible odour, such as pheromones, thanks to their complex olfactory system, which involves a feature called Jacobsen's organ in addition to their nose.
    <br>
    <br>
    A butt sniff is the canine counterpart of a human handshake, allowing dogs to recognise one another as individuals and distinguish between sexes, ages, health issues, and social order.
    <br>
    <br>
    Dogs use body language and physical signals to communicate; lifted, waving tails indicate pleasure, while tucked tails indicate fear. When greeting other pups, a wagging tail will help disperse those chemical scents. Tails are useful for balance and speed, such as the swimming retriever's rudder-like tail or the sight-whip-like hound's tail, which allows them to change direction in the blink of an eye.
</p>

<h3>Why Do Dogs Walk in Circles Before Lying Down?</h3>
<p>
    Dogs had to make their own bed in the days before fluffy pillows. They created a safe nest for themselves and their young by flattening the grasses and brush for themselves and their young and driving out critters like snakes. Scratching gives their bed a smell, which is released by tiny glands in their feet, further identifying the room as their own.
    <br>
    <br>
    Some of these instinctual habits and functional anatomic features are part of what makes dogs such interesting animals, even though we've domesticated them!
